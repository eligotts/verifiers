## Documentation Updates

Any PR that adds or modifies core user-facing functionality as described in `docs/` must update the relevant documentation. This includes changes classes and APIs described in:

- `docs/overview.md`
- `docs/environments.md`
- `docs/evaluation.md`
- `docs/training.md`
- `docs/reference.md`
- `docs/faqs.md`

Notable information which should be available for reference, but does not neatly map to a specific documentation section, should be mentioned in `docs/faqs.md`.

If such changes are detected without a corresponding documentation update, request that the author add an entry.
